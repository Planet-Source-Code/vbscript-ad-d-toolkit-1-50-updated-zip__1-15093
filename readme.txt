This program was created to cover the speciic needs of the
programmer's local campaign.  This is currently loosly based
on AD&D 1st edition rules with player expansion modules.  I
know I am behind with 3rd edition being out, but we are not
planning on moving from beyond the point we are now at for a
long while.  We are in the middle of an epic campaign spanning
more than 2 years of actual play time.

Please look for updates at the following two sites:
http://dellepro.dellhost.com/bbuskey/
http://www.planetsourcecode.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.15093/lngWId.1
/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm

I have included the source code for this project so you can
update/change the requirements to meet your campaign/group.

Thanks for trying this out...
